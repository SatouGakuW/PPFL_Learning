This is an application that runs privacy-preserving federated learning with Trusted Execution Environments. A layer-wise training technique is used for keeping the training layers always inside trusted areas. The application has two parts: 1) the server side with SGX using [OpenEnclave SDK](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave) for secure aggregation; 2) the client-side with TrustZone using [OP-TEE](https://www.op-tee.org/).

# Prerequisites
To run this application, you will need **one SGX-enabled PC** as the server and **one TrustZone-enabled device** as the client.

Check [this link](https://github.com/ayeks/SGX-hardware) and make sure your PC has SGX.

Check [this link](https://optee.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general/platforms.html#platforms-supported) for TrustZone-enabled devices with OPTEE supports.


# Setup
## (1) Set up Client Side

Follow [client side instruction](client_side_trustzone/README.md). In the end, make sure you can train a model on-device using TrustZone. For example, test it using the command below:

```
darknetp classifier train -pp_start 4 -pp_end 10 cfg/mnist.dataset cfg/mnist_lenet.cfg
```

When everything is ready, you will see output showing that it starts training the model.


## (2) Set up Server Side


### Step 1:

You will need *Ubuntu 18.04* PC and first install Open Enclave SDK for supporting the use of SGX. Follow [this instruction](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/blob/master/docs/GettingStartedDocs/install_oe_sdk-Ubuntu_18.04.md) to do so.

To test whether you are able to run samples/applications, build samples following [BuildSamplesLinux](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/blob/master/samples/BuildSamplesLinux.md), and then try to run the `Hello World` sample.

### Step 2:

First, clone the (server-side) code and compile it using Open Enclave SDK.

```
git clone https://github.com/mofanv/privacy-preserving-federated-learning.git
cd ./privacy-preserving-federated-learning/server_side_sgx/
make build
make run
```

### Step 3:

set `IP_CLIENT_1`, `PASSWORD_CLIENT1`, `NUM_ROUNDS`. `NUM_CLIENTS`, `PP_START`, `PP_END`, `DATASET`, `MODEL`, etc in `fl_script/fl_tee*.sh` file. where,

- `IP_CLIENT_1` refers to the IP of the client's device
- `PASSWORD_CLIENT1` refers to the user password of the device
- `NUM_ROUNDS` refers to the number of communication rounds
- `NUM_CLIENTS` refers to the number of clients (note that here we simulate multiple clients using one device)
- `PP_START` and `PP_END` refer to the index of layers inside the TEE
- `DATASET` and `MODEL` refer to the dataset and model being used


### Step 4:

run `fl_tee*.sh` for FL with TEE protection on training at both server and client-side. For example,

```
cd fl_script/
./fl_tee_layerwise.sh
```

- `fl_tee_standard_ss.sh` refers to standard FL with a separate saving of weights (i.e. REE and TEE). As opposed to that, `fl_tee_standard_noss.sh` is saving weights together.
- `fl_tee_transfer_once.sh` refers to transfer learning using FL and the feature extractor is communicated only once.
- `fl_tee_transfer_updates.sh` refers to transfer learning using FL and the feature extractor keeps updating in each communication round.
- `fl_tee_layerwise.sh` refers to greedy layer-wise learning using FL.



*Note that in the worst case you could try to run both sides with simulation, i.e., Open Enclave on PC without SGX and OPTEE in QEMU. However, this is not tested.*
